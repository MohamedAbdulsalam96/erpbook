Introduction

So here you are on your desk at three in the afternoon tapping your fingers on your diary, feeling restless. You’ve been contemplating on starting your own business since long. In these times of economic uncertainty, rampant bankruptcies and businesses closing all around, it’s pretty tough to make a decision. You like your job but you want to push yourself to do something you absolutely LOVE.

SHOP + SHOES. Yea! Clothes and accessories and makeup and bags the list can go on. But you love your shoes and you would like to help the other women out there to find their favorite shoes. You keep running these things in your head and you are sensing, let me take the plunge. It’s not like I’m giving up my job right?

So you discuss it with your family and they’ve agreed to help you out with some money. You go to the bank to see if they can offer you a loan. First you have to rent a shop, then maybe buy it and then open branches in other all over the city. But thats going too far. One step at a time.

Since your family and friends are supportive of your venture you go ahead with it. You put your best foot forward and open your first store  in a nice neighborhood, “Lady Luck Shoes”. All your friends come in for the opening and a few buy some shoes too. It feels great to make your first sale! 

Slowly as days go by, you build a knack for keeping the best variety at reasonable prices and build a reputation. Customers are pouring in and women are all talking about it. Your sales are growing by the day.

You build such a reputation that the big shoe companies are selling directly to you. You also decide to setup a big warehouse to store all those lovely shoes. Now the smaller shops are also buying from you.

But running a business isn’t easy and there are a lot of tiny things you need to keep track of, i’s to dot and t’s to cross. Your realize there are lots of things like accounting, stock, sales, managing your employees etc. you need to be on top of.

You ask your best friend for help. She tells you that you need an ERP  something software they use in her company. Now you have heard this term before. You Google a bit and find out an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is a software that helps you keep track of everything in your business. You feel this is exactly what you need.

You hunt for a guide on how ERP systems can help a business to grow.  You come across The ERP Book. As you keep a watchful eye on your store, you are soon lost in the new world of ERP!
