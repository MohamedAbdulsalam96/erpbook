Managing Your Team

Human resources is a term used to describe the individuals who make up the workforce of an organization, although it is also applied in labor economics to, for example, business sectors or even whole nations. Human resources is also the name of the function within an organization charged with the overall responsibility for implementing strategies and policies relating to the management of individuals (i.e. the human resources). This function title is often abbreviated to the initials 'HR'.
According to Wikipedia the definition of “HR” i.e. human resources means








Well in lay mans term it basically means taking care of your employees. You’ve already established your business in Bangalore and Mumbai. Obviously you’ll hire people to work in your store. You can’t do everything right. So you’ll have people, say  3-4 who’ll keep track of all the inventory, 5-6 to attend to the customers, maybe 2-3 to clean the store and see that everything’s in place throughout the day and 1-2 cashiers and 1 manager. These are your employees who work for you. They help you in your business. They are the people who actually work everyday to make your business successful. Obviously you need to keep them happy which means provide them with good facilities and pay them on time. 

Since yours is a high end store, your employees are prim and proper and you wouldn’t just hire any tom, dick and harry. On the whole think about big fashionable stores. Getting my point? The first thing that comes in our mind when we talk about HR is salary slips. 

HR is basically all about PEOPLE. Because without people in your company or business, you really cant do much. So keeping this in mind, you should have the right people who are loyal, passionate and hardworking. That’s where HR comes into the picture. People working in the HR dept recruit the right people to work for you, take care of them and when needed weed them out incase they don’t meet your needs. There’s strength in numbers and with a strong team you can reach your goals.

So keeping our shoe business in mind, you’ve recruited the appropriate people to do your job. How will you keep track of their performance their attendance and salaries? To motivate your employees maybe you would like to give a bonus to those who’ve worked really well for e.g. provided for sales.etc. You need a system that helped you do all this. You can’t go to every employee and ask them face to face about their progress. It’s obvious they’ll lie and talk good about themselves. There should be a systematic way of dealing with this. It shouldn’t be that some may go unnoticed cause they don’t present themselves well or something like that. Usually if you see big offices they’ll have all the details of their employees, and every time they punch in and out their attendance is recorded. And if they have full attendance they get a full pay.

Based on your rules you can provide bonuses, paid leaves, casual leaves etc. so with erp next you can fill in the details of all your employee’s and each employee gets a unique id. Everyday when they enter your shop they meet your manager so that he enters the attendance. Suppose some employee is sick he can submit a leave application. if he has a certain amount of leave allocated to him and it isn’t over then his salary wouldn’t be deducted. So this way everything is done systematically and you don’t have to memorize it. The system does it for you. 

At the end of the month you can provide salary slips for each employee and the salary is calculated based on the taxes and attendance and leave without pay etc. So this makes it easier for you to give your employees the salary on time. Similarly if one of your boys is travelling to deliver shoes to your customer or he needs to travel for your work you can provide expense vouchers. You can have appraisals for each employee and view the performance reports. Based on this you can decide whether you need to raise their salaries or maybe give them a bonus or you need to terminate their contract. Let’s say if Mr.X has sold an approximate of 90 shoes per month he definitely needs a bonus to boost his morale. Or say mr.y is terribly sick he definitely needs an off without cutting his pay. This way Human Resource department takes care of all the employees need. And this way they see to it that they everyone is happy. Cause if they are happy they’ll put in their 100% and work better for you and in the end you’ll be happy because this improves you business.

The different functions that ERP next provides you with are.
a) employee- where you fill in each of your employees details and each employee gets an unique id assigned to them.
b) attendance- you can keep a track of you employee’s attendance by entering their attendance appropriately everyday.
c) Leave allocation- each employee can be provided with a certain amount of leaves they can take without cutting their salary. C’mon you need to be fair. We are all humans after all. Not machines.
d) Leave application- if an employee needs to take a leave for say a small vacation or sick leave etc. he can submit it to the manager.
e) salary slips- salary slips can be provided to each employee at the end of the month. Taking into account all the attendance and expense vouchers to leaves.
f)appraisal- you can check each employees perfomance and check the progress made. based on this you can provide bonuses or raise their salaries or position. this way you are actually providing a way to push them to do better work for you.
