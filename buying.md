Buying

Now since you’ve understood the entire scenario of what goes in selling a product, let’s consider buying a product. Don’t worry it’ll be a piece of cake. See how fast you are already on the way to becoming a  good sales person. BRILLIANT!

Your customer say Ms.Xyz has placed an order for a nice Gucci red pump heels. And she wants to gift this to her best friend for her 25th birthday. She wants it to be delivered within two weeks. You say it’ll be done, with confidence. You don’t realize till the last minute that that shoe isn’t available with you. Cause you forgot about it and gave it to some other customer. Now you’ve annoyed Ms.Xyz. Customer dissatisfaction = bad business reputation= eventual loss in business. 

With erpnext you can track your customer, the orders placed by them, and the sales invoice, like we’ve learned in the earlier chap. Let’s go through it again. You’ll enter the customer’s details in your system. Next step would be to enter the order. If this item isn’t in stock then you won’t be able to deliver it. And you can check your stock levels. Since that shoe isn’t in stock then you have to buy it from a distributor or ask your workers to make it in you warehouse, isn’t it? This is where the buying module comes into the picture. When there’s no stock available you can raise an indent which will be seen by your purchase dept.

So let’s repeat the same situation with erpnext. Ms.Xyz calls you up to place the order. You’ll enter her details in your database. Then type in the order details. If the item is in stock then fine, but if its not then it’ll prompt that the item isn’t available. So then you’ll enter the buying module and raise an indent. Your purchase dept. sees this and places a purchase order from your supplier or distributor. Once the item is bought in you can then deliver it to Ms.Xyz within the desired time. She’s happy, you’re happy. No Backlog + Good Service + Satisfied customer = Good business reputation + Better Sales + PROFFFFFFFFFFFIITSSS!!! Looks good, isn’t it?




Now consider a scenario when you’ve asked your supplier to make this red shoe for you. You then ask him how much he’s going to charge you and he says 7000 Rs. You just feel that this is too much he’s asking for and previously he charged less. But you don’t know how much. With erpnext you can track the previous order that you purchased by this supplier. Isn’t that good? You can then fight with him and show him the rates he charged previously. Why should you let this opportunity go ha? You can’t waste money like this yaar.
Ok so now are you getting convinced about how erpnext can make your life easy? Not yet? No worries. Not only can you track what are the charges charged by a particular supplier previously, but also track all the suppliers that provide you with the same item. You can then decide from who want to buy your item from at the best price. This helps you curtail unnecessary expenses. You can also track whether the order you’ve placed is still in transit or no. this will give you an idea of what’s happening to all the orders you’ve placed. So if the delivery of the order is taking a lot of time then you can call your supplier and ask him to send the order jaldi. You then don’t have to wait till the last minute and then yell at supplier and spoil your mood. 
That’s not all; you can view all your pending bills you have to pay to your suppliers. See you don’t only have to satisfy your customer but also keep your supplier happy na. At the end of the day it’s your supplier who will send all your raw materials and final product. If you don’t pay him on time and delay it way too much then how can you expect him to deliver your order on time? Then in turn you can’t deliver Ms.Xyz’s Gucci shoe on time. So you see the cycle? Bad nah! 
Before explaining the different functions of this module let me just define what buying means technically. You may be thinking that this is like narrating the entire Ramayana and then asking who is Ram. But guys, c’mon now you need to be technically sound also rite? Don’t worry it’s not going to be difficult. I’ve utaod it from the most resourceful site now a day that everyone checks out, WIKIPEDIA that is, If you haven’t guessed it yet. 









Purchasing refers to a business or organization attempting for acquiring goods or services to accomplish the goals of the enterprise. Though there are several organizations that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between organizations. 





Now since you know this lets get back to the functions of the buying module. It includes suppliers, indent, purchase order, and purchase invoice.
Suppliers- This is used when you want to keep track of all your suppliers that supply the items you require. Keeping the shoe business that you have into picture you might have different suppliers providing you with the raw materials to make a shoe, like soles, fabric, adhesives etc. or a supplier who provides the entire shoe to you. You enter his name, address and country.
Indent- When the item the order has been placed for isn’t there with you then you raise an indent. It’s like a reminder to tell you that this product isn’t available and you need to purchase it from your supplier. So Ms.Xyz had placed an order for those red shoes and it isn’t in your stock. So you will raise an indent by entering the item, that is, those red shoes, and from which warehouse you want it from.
Purchase Order- Now you’ve raised an indent. And your supplier has sent you the quotation for those red shoes Ms.Xyz wanted; if you are satisfied with the rates you’ll send a purchase order to this supplier. It’s like a confirmation document that you have bought this item from the respective supplier.
Purchase Invoice-Its similar to the sales invoice except here it keeps a track of all your outstanding amounts you need to pay to your suppliers. If this isn’t kept track of then you may forget about it and after a certain amount of days you might have to pay more. Just like your Vodafone bills after the due date you pay an extra 100 bucks. This continues and hence waste you money on something that’s completely not called for. More expense and less income= Loss. Which you don’t want right?






Points to remember

Knowledge of all your suppliers better is the relationship between you and them. Hence better service from them. Then all your orders will be delivered to you on time. And thus you can sell it to your customer on time.
Tracking of all your purchase invoices will lead to paying your bills on time. Thus curtailing unnecessary expenses.
Raising indents gives you a list of all the raw materials required or the items required by you which needs to be purchased.
Purchase order is like a formal document you produce which just confirms that you’ve bought a particular item from a certain supplier at a particular rate.
On the whole if your customer wants an item that isn’t with you at the moment, the buying module helps you with raising an indent and produces a purchase order once you’ve decided on the supplier and rates.
When the items are bought on time and you deliver these to the respective customers on time. Better is your value in the market.
You can track the bills you have to pay to your suppliers. And keep him happy too. Cause he’s the one who’ll get the product for you.
All the suppliers from whom you’ve bought a particular item from, you can get a report of that and then make a decision.
