# Selling

What is a sales cycle? 

Consider you want to sell your computer to a close friend of yours. The first thing you would do is give them a demonstration on how your computer works and offer them a rate that you would expect. Your friend thinks about it and gives you a positive response but he/she wants you to adjust your proposed rates a little. In this way you discuss the appropriate amount and make a deal. You then pack your computer in a nice case and deliver it to his/her house. He/she then pays you the amount that you have discussed.

Keep Customers Happy

But this is a very simple scenario. Since  you are a big businessman handling a business of selling shoes, obviously you’ll have a lot of customers and a lot of other people who could be your potential customers. Your main aim would be to keep your customers happy and provide them with the best of services so that they come back to you and talk about you to others. When you satisfy your customers your sales will increase and ultimately you are bound to make profits. Which all of us are concerned about at the end of the day.

Taking Orders

Suppose you have four customers who place an order for 5 or more shoes. You’ve written it down on a piece of paper. You’ve asked your delivery team  to pack the shoes ordered by the 1st customer. In the meanwhile your mom calls you up (mom’s always call up in the middle of some work UFF!). Then you get back to work you’ve forgotten about an order placed by one of the customer. As the day progresses this customer calls you up all baffled and angry. Because you didn’t deliver his/her order. This would obviously hamper your business and profits.

Hence what comes into the picture is a nice systematic way of tracking your customer, their orders, and the deliveries. This could make it easy for you to track all the orders placed, the quotations you’ve made for different customers and the invoices etc. You can then answer your mom’s, wife’s/hubbies, girlfriend’s/boyfriend’s call without getting pissed off with them unnecessarily. Poor people they are only concerned about you. Anyway so when you have a nice system to do all the sales related work for you then nothing like it. Don’t you think so? 

The Sales Cycle

Before that let’s discuss about what are the functions that one generally needs to know while fulfilling a typical sales cycle. 

Customer Data: It’s obvious, you would want to know about your customers and save their information like name, address, phone no. and so on and so forth. 

Inquiries: A customer can also inquire about the rates before purchasing which needs to be tracked so that you can answer every inquiry made.

Quotes: Customers may also want a formal written price list or quotation from you, especially if you are selling to other businesses, like smaller stores.

Sales Orders: Once you’ve got all your customer’s details with you its easy to associate each customer with the orders they’ve placed. As you’ve figured out the next step would be to keep an account of all the orders that have been placed by different customers. 

So in a nutshell sales includes knowing your customer, then the details of the order that your customer has placed (so that you don’t mismatch the orders with wrong customers or even more worse FORGET it) and then you deliver it to your destination. This way you satisfy your customers by delivering their orders on time thus increasing your sales which there by increases the profits. Yeah you heard it right PROFITS. Awesome isn’t it?

Remembering your customers: Won’t it be nice that if your customer calls up, you can just pull out his/her information and history of doing business with you and say, “Should I do the same order again?” or “Its been a while since you bought some nice shoes”?

CRM - Customer Relationship Management

Now you might be wondering how will I do all of this?  I’m not Bill Gates. Of course sweetheart you’re not either, you don’t need to be one. Don’t worry, this is where a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software comes in handy and its quite easy to use. 



Points to remember

1. Keep track of all your customers. 

2. Record all information of the orders placed. So you can check and also see if the orders are delivered. Cause if the orders aren’t delivered then you’ll ANNOY your customers.

3. You’ve delivered the product but you’ve forgotten about your payment. No payment = free product = loss.

On the whole, a satisfied customer = better sales = PROFITS.
